## **Implementation Workflow**

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**:
   - Users upload datasets, and the platform automatically cleans and preprocesses the data for machine learning.
   - Summary statistics and visualizations are provided to ensure transparency.

2. **Model Building and Selection**:
   - Algorithms are automatically chosen based on dataset type and problem requirements (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed to achieve the best possible performance.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Trained models are containerized using Docker.
   - Kubernetes manages deployment and scaling across production environments.
   - Jenkins automates the CI/CD process, ensuring updated models are seamlessly integrated.

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - The platform continuously monitors deployed models for performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and latency.
   - Retraining workflows are triggered if performance drops below a defined threshold.
